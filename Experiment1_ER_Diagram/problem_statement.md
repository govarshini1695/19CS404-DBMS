# ER Diagram Workshop – Submission Template

## Objective
To understand and apply ER modeling concepts by creating ER diagrams for real-world applications.

## Purpose
Gain hands-on experience in designing ER diagrams that represent database structure including entities, relationships, attributes, and constraints.

# Scenario A: City Fitness Club Management

**Business Context:**  
FlexiFit Gym wants a database to manage its members, trainers, and fitness programs.

**Requirements:**  
- Members register with name, membership type, and start date.  
- Each member can join multiple programs (Yoga, Zumba, Weight Training).  
- Trainers assigned to programs; a program may have multiple trainers.  
- Members may book personal training sessions with trainers.  
- Attendance recorded for each session.  
- Payments tracked for memberships and sessions.

### Entities and Attributes
| **Entity**     | **Attributes (PK, FK)**                                                                                                        | **Notes**                                       |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------- |
| **Member**     | **PK:** Member\_id <br> Attributes: Name, Membership\_type                                                                     | Stores details of gym members                   |
| **Trainer**    | **PK:** Trainer\_id <br> Attributes: Name, Specialization                                                                      | Stores trainer details                          |
| **Program**    | **PK:** Program\_id <br> Attributes: Program\_name, Description, Schedule                                                      | Training programs offered                       |
| **Session**    | **PK:** Session\_id <br> **FKs:** Member\_id, Trainer\_id, Program\_id <br> Attributes: Session\_type, Session\_schedule       | Represents a training session                   |
| **Payment**    | **PK:** Payment\_id <br> **FKs:** Member\_id, Session\_id <br> Attributes: Payment\_date, Amount, Payment\_type, Reference\_id | Stores payment records for memberships/sessions |
| **Attendance** | **PK:** Attendance\_id <br> **FKs:** Member\_id, Session\_id <br> Attributes: Status                                           | Tracks member attendance in sessions            |


### Relationships and Constraints
| **Relationship**          | **Entities Involved** | **Cardinality**              | **Participation**                     | **Notes**                                                                      |
| ------------------------- | --------------------- | ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Assigned\_by**          | Member – Trainer      | 1 Trainer : Many Members     | Member (Total), Trainer (Partial)     | Each member must be assigned a trainer; a trainer may train multiple members   |
| **Specified\_course**     | Session – Program     | Many Sessions : 1 Program    | Session (Total), Program (Partial)    | Each session belongs to a program; a program may have multiple sessions        |
| **Specified\_time**       | Member – Session      | 1 Member : Many Sessions     | Member (Partial), Session (Total)     | A member can have many sessions; each session is scheduled for one member      |
| **Amount\_collected**     | Session – Payment     | 1 Session : Many Payments    | Session (Partial), Payment (Total)    | A session may have multiple payments; each payment must be linked to a session |
| **Presence\_in\_session** | Attendance – Session  | Many Attendances : 1 Session | Attendance (Total), Session (Partial) | Tracks attendance per session; each attendance record belongs to one session   |


### Assumptions
- All IDs (Member_id, Trainer_id, Program_id, Session_id, Payment_id, Attendance_id) are primary keys and unique.
- Foreign key relationships ensure referential integrity (e.g., a payment cannot exist without a valid member and session).
- The system assumes each member is assigned at least one trainer and the system records both financial (payments) and non-financial (attendance, schedules) aspects of gym operations.
